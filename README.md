# Serverless Benchmarks

WIP project to run regular, repeatable benchmarks so we can make decisions about runtimes, sdks, layers, tools, etc.

Implement the same function or application with different options to have an apples-to-apples comparison. The functions are executed via EventBridge rule every 24 hours and stats are recorded.
